        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>185g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>185g high-quality dark chocolate</li>
            <li>50g white chocolate</li>
            <li>50g milk chocolate</li>
            <li>275g golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>85g plain flour</li>
            <li>40g cocoa powder</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cut the unsalted butter into small cubes and break the dark chocolate into small
                pieces and place them <br>both in a medium bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top
                so it rests on the rim <br>of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until
                the butter and chocolate have <br>melted, stirring occasionally to mix them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film
                and put in the <br>microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to
                room temperature. While you <br>wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the
                middle of your oven and pre-heat the oven to <br>180C for fan ovens, otherwise 160C/Gas
                Mark 4.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of kitchen foil (or non-stick
                baking parchment) to <br>line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a
                sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and <br>shake the sieve so they run through together
                and you get rid of any lumps.
            </li>
            <li>
                Chop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.
            </li>
            <li>
                Break 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an
                electric mixer on <br>maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and
                creamy, like a milk shake. This <br>can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your
                mixer is. You’ll know it’s ready when the <br>mixture becomes really pale and about double
                its original volume. Another check is to turn off the <br>mixer, lift out the beaters and
                wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters <br>leaves a trail
                on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with
                a rubber <br>spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up
                the opposite side and in <br>again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure
                of eight, moving the bowl round after <br>each folding so you can get at it from all sides,
                until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled <br>dark brown. The idea is to
                marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour
                mixture, shaking <br>the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture
                will look dry and <br>dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently
                and patiently, it will end up looking <br>gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you
                should, as you don’t want to overdo this mixing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula.
                Gently ease the <br>mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side
                across the top to level it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull
                the shelf out a <br>bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s
                not quite done, so slide it back in <br>and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny,
                papery crust and the sides are just beginning to <br>come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.
            </li>
            <li>
                Leave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin,
                lift up the <br>protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re
                using a normal tin, lift out the <br>brownie with the foil (or parchment). Cut into quarters, then
                cut each quarter into four squares and finally <br>into triangles.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            They’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.

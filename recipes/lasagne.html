        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>800g passata</li>
            <li>750g lean beef mince</li>
            <li>550g White sauce</li>
            <li>200ml hot beef stock</li>
            <li>300g fresh lasagne sheets</li>
            <li>125g ball of mozzarella, torn into thin strips</li>
            <li>90g prosciutto <em>(optional)</em></li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Grated nutmeg <em>(optional)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a pan and cook all the
                lean beef mince in two batches <br>for about 10 minutes. The beef should be
                browned over completely before it is considered cooked.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you chose to include it, finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto and stir
                it through the mixture in the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour all the passata and hot beef stock into the pan. Add a little grated
                nutmeg if you wish, then season <br>with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring the mixture up to the boil, then simmer for around 30 minutes and/or
                until the sauce looks rich. <br>While the sauce is simmering, pre-heat your oven
                to 180C for fan ovens, otherwise 160C/Gas Mark 4 <br>and lightly oil an ovenproof
                dish (around 30cm x 20cm).
            </li>
            <li>
                When you are satisfied with the sauce, spoon some of it into the ovenproof
                dish until there is a nice <br>layer of the sauce covering the bottom of the dish.
                Cover the layer of sauce with a few pasta sheets and <br>then drizzle 130g white
                sauce over the pasta sheets. Repeat this three times, using all the remaining
                <br>white sauce on the third layer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scatter the torn mozzarella over the top. If you chose to include the prosciutto,
                arrange it on top also.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put the ovenproof dish in the oven for 45 minutes, until the top of the dish is
                bubbling and lightly-browned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the dish from the oven and allow to cool slightly before eating. Enjoy!

        <ol>
            <li>
                Pre-heat your oven to 180C for fan ovens, otherwise 160C/Gas Mark 4. Butter
                two 20cm sandwich <br>tins and line with non-stick baking paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, beat 200g caster sugar, 200g softened butter, 4 beaten eggs, 
                200g self-raising flour, <br>1 tsp baking powder and 2 tbsp milk together until 
                you have a smooth, soft batter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the mixture between the tins, smooth the surface with a spatula or 
                the back of a spoon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for about 20 mins until golden and the cake springs back when pressed. 
                When satisfied, turn <br>onto a cooling rack and leave to cool completely.
            </li>
            <li>
                To make the filling, beat the 100g softened butter until smooth and creamy, 
                then gradually beat in <br>140g sifted icing sugar and a drop of vanilla extract 
                (if youâ€™re using it).
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread the buttercream over the bottom of one of the sponges. Top it with 170g 
                strawberry jam and <br>sandwich the second sponge on top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dust with a little icing sugar before serving. Keep in an airtight container 
                and eat within 2 days.
